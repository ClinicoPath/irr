Changes in 0.x releases of irr:
=======
 0.83: - The function N2.cohen.kappa was included (Thanks to Puspendra Singh
         for providing this function)
 0.82: - An error in the function icc was corrected. The old function returned
         p-values bigger than 1 for very low icc estimates.
         (Thanks to Elmar Kisslinger for raising this issue)
 0.81: - An error in the function kripp.alpha was corrected
 0.80: - The function relInterIntra was included (Thanks to Tore Wentzel-Larsen
         for providing this function)
       - An error in the function N.cohen.kappa was corrected
 0.70: - The following functions from the concord package were included:
         kripp.alpha (Krippendorff's alpha), rater.bias (test of bias 
         between two raters) and stuart.maxwell.mh (Stuart-Maxwell marginal 
         homogeneity test).
         (Thanks to Jim Lemon for providing these functions)
       - The new function bhapkar was added. It calculates the Bhapkar 
         coefficient of concordance for two raters.
 0.63: - Errors in functions kappa2 and maxwell were corrected
 0.62: - Problematic output characters were removed
 0.61: - Calls to deprecated functions were removed
 0.6:  - Corrected computation of the large sample standard error of the
         weighted kappa coefficient for two raters and the Fleiss' Kappa for
         m raters.
         (Thanks to Tatsuo Kagimura for this hint)
       - Corrected output and documentation of the intraclass correlation 
         coefficient's (ICC) estimate of average score ICCs.
         (Thanks to Jonathan Williams for raising this issue)
       - New functions: agree (computation of simple and extended percentage 
         agreement among several raters), maxwell (Maxwell's RE-coefficient
         for binary scales), iota (interrater agreement for multivariate
         observations)
